# Project DLAI
Machine unlearning is an emerging concept in the field of machine learning that refers to the ability to remove or "unlearn" specific information from a trained model. This is particularly relevant in contexts where data needs to be deleted for privacy reasons, regulatory compliance, or simply to correct errors in the training data.

The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate unlearning techniques in neural network models using two different datasets: MNIST, which contains images of handwritten digits, and UrbanSound8K, which includes audio clips of urban sounds. The aim is to observe how this process affects the accuracy and overall generalization ability of the models.
